# Typing Tutor for JavaScript/React programmers #

[Demo](https://funforks.github.io/typing)

## Overview
Most typing tutor programs focus on plain text. They do not provide much meaningful practice for symbol keys, such as `"'!?<>_~$%^&|()[]{}\/*=-+`, which are:
* Commonly used when writing computer code
* Typed at the extreme edges of the keyboard, often with the little fingers.

Coding languages often use camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case, UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE, and kebab-case which require dexterity with the Shift Key. The Enter Key and Tab Keys are also used far more often when coding than when typing plain text, as are keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl-Shift-C, and the function keys.

This typing tutor allows you to practise typing typical programming expressions, with a focus on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. Simple examples from bash may also be included.

## Diversity of keyboard layouts
Although most programming languages use keywords derived from US English, many programmers come from non-English speaking countries (c.f. [HackerRank](https://distantjob.com/blog/countries-to-find-best-programmers/), [DistantJob](https://distantjob.com/blog/how-many-developers-are-in-the-world/)), including many countries where the Latin alphabet is not the norm. End users might therefore use a wide range of keyboard layouts, such as QWERTY, AZERTY, QUERTZ, Dvorak, Colemak, BÃ©po and others. The position of the symbol keys on these layouts varies widely.

This typing tutor aims to help you to improve your typing speed on your favourite keyboard, whether you are a beginner or an experienced typist. It also aims to encourage you to use keyboard shortcuts, including custom shortcuts that you have created for yourself.

## Motivation
You can team up with your friends so that you can compare your progress. You can also team up with users with a similar profile anywhere in the world, and compete to move up into a team of more proficient typists.
